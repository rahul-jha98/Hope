# Hope

* Depression is a serious problem in the world, often overlooked because of its difficult diagnosis. Depression often leads to suicidal thoughts and needs to be curbed, which is only possible if it is diagnosed early. 

* With that very intent, we have created Hope. It is an android app that uses Machine Learning to predict the possibility/extent of depression in an individual.

* Hope hosts chat rooms that facilitate group therapy sessions for users suffering from similar problems. The user enters
his/her state of mind and we use NLP to suggest them the appropriate chat room.

* Every chat room has a bot moderator that directs the flow of the chat.
